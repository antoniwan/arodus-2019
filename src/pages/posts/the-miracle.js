      <h1>The Miracle</h1>

      <AuthorBox />

      <p>
        I've been searching all my life for a miracle. I desire to feel and
        possibly participate in that special thing that religious people talk
        about whenever they claim to experience extraordinary serendipities and
        truth be told, I haven't had any luck at feeling or participating in the
        miracles of others. Maybe I haven't been looking hard enough or in the
        correct places. But recently, something happened to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My wife and I are expecting a baby girl. I was looking at my wife's huge
        tits and I noticed that her nipples were turning darker. "Mamita, your
        nipples are getting darker!?", I told her. "Yes. When nearing
        childbirth, our bodies make our nipples turn darker so that babies, who
        are kinda blind when they are newborn, can find them easier. Like
        contrast on a website's color scheme for ADA compliance."
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind, this is my firstborn child and I had never witnessed how
        truly unimaginable women's bodies are. Capable of shifting organs
        around, developing, nurturing and birthing new life, among other things.
        I was truly awestruck and that sent me in a spiral of questions and
        googling that resulted in going through the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unrelated to the above, days later, I find myself reading "Astrophysics
        for People in a Hurry" by Neil DeGrasse Tyson and I stumble upon this
        gem:
      </p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          Within the chemically rich liquid oceans, by a mechanism yet to be
          discovered, organic molecules transitioned to self-replicating life."
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>And that was when it hit me.</p>
      <p>
        A nuclear bomb went off in my head and everything I know (which is very
        little) about animals, reproduction, biology, etcetera, clicked and
        interconnected with my own life experiences, like the fusion reactions,
        my neurons just exploded dude. Every animal, every plant, every person,
        every experience that I've had with nature, life and death, became
        interconnected and it was evident. Like a puzzle that found its last
        piece. I finally got it!
      </p>
      <p>The Miracle IS LIFE ITSELF! </p>
      <p>
        I've been looking my whole life for something so visible but for some
        stupid reason, I wasn't able to see it until now. ANY and ALL LIFE on
        this PLANET is a f***** MIRACLE (tautology intentional), and it is
        breathtaking! Beautiful! Impossible to explain! Impossible to replicate!
      </p>
      <p>Show animal images </p>
      <p>
        After the euphoria of this huge personal discovery (lmao) wore off, it
        kinda became clear to me that the phrase "Life on this planet is so
        improbable that it is a miracle." was an acceptable intellectual idea.
        So I propose that Life in this beautiful planet Earth is recognized, not
        as a miracle, but as the Miracle. Embracing life, all life, from its
        unknown inception at the beginning of history, to all the living
        organisms that we know today, as the Miracle will change the way we view
        and commute with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that I'm not bringing religion or society into this idea.
        I'm only referring to the unbelievable and improbable mechanisms that
        make all life possible on this planet. No other observable planet shows
        signs of organic life as we know it. But biological diversity is so
        expansive and expressive that we can't even quantify it, and this should
        humble us. We should stop looking, like I was, looking for the unknowns
        and start seeing and observing what is happening around us and is so
        evident as life.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of this is super opinionated and serves no real purpose other than
        ranting
      </p>

      <p>
        But why am I just grasping this notion at 33 and only after my
        circumstances are allowing me to witness the miracle of childbirth
        through my wife and having enough free time to read an introductory book
        on astrophysics? Why aren't we openly talking about it and celebrating
        life as we should? Why aren't we treating life as the miracle it is? Do
        we do these things and I've also avoided noticing this?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it's because we take life for granted. I think it's because we
        don't see or don't want to see this simple fact that all life is a
        miracle. Is it because we don't want to act accordingly or is it because
        we are too blind in our rampant selfishness, ego, and desire to consume
        and acquire material possessions? I don't know. But now I do know why
        waking up feels so good. Now I comprehend why we seek to avoid death
        like it's the worst thing that could happen.
      </p>

      <p>I've always felt inspired and fortunate by communing with nature. </p>
